###  Refresher on React basics:
  - Props vs State
  - setState
  - Sharing state + Callbacks


### Redux Basics:
  - What is redux? Why?
  - Actions vs "Action Creators"
  - Dispatch
  - Creating the store:
    - createStore(), compose(), applyMiddleware()
    - Reducers
    - Root Reducers
  - Handling Async Actions
    - Middleware (Thunk)


### Reducer Gotchas:
  - Handling mutations
    - Hint: (Always return a new copy of state)
    - Suggestion: Immutable.js
  - Combining Reducers


###  [Store API](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html)
  - getState()
  - subscribe()
  - dispatch()
  - replaceReducer() â€” Note: We wont cover this today.

### [React-Redux] (https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
  - connect()
  - <Provider/>
